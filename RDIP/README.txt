EXPERIMENT 1:(UNIT 4)
OBJECTIVE: To know how to form logically correct sentences from the given words. 
Created the folder by strictly following the directory stucture.
When we click on experiment, dropdown menu of "select-language" appears.
After we select a language, jumbled words appear and when we click on them, a sentence starts to form in the order of words clicked on.
According to the message, our objective is to form the correct sentence, both semantically and syntactically.
As we keep clicking the words, the words keep getting added to the previously chosen words in the same order and keep vanishing from the original jumbled sentence as you are clicking them. As soon as all words are chosen and the original jumbled sentence is empty, another clickable button called “check the correctness of the sentence”  is visible which when clicked tells you whether your sentence is correct. 
If what you have chosen is correct and the sentence is syntactically and semantically right, it should Right answer!!! otherwise Wrong answer!!!
If the answer is wrong, another button is displayed that says, Get Correct Sentence which when clicked displays the correct answer(s).
Whenever the button “check the correctness of sentence” is pressed, the Get Correct sentence button is invoked. 
The English and Hindi Sentences are randomly chosen from a list of sentences. Every time English or Hindi is chosen, a new random English/Hindi Sentence comes into play. 
We can add few more animations and colours to make it eye-pleasing and make it user-friendly.
